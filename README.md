# WekinatorHacks


#1. Hand_Position Hacks

- I built this hand position hack by creating a feature based off of the x and y differentials of your left and right hands.

#####Directions

- Using the WekiInputHelper, make a feature of input_1 - input_32(delta x) and input_2 - input_33(delta y)
- change the when to send to every 2 seconds
- download and run the actionsay.py file
- open the wekproj listed in the file, run it, and see if you can get all 4 outputs (labelled as 2-5)
